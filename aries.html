<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Aries like to pretend like they are very tough and feel very little emotion besides anger, but they have soft spots for certain people and can get their emotions hurt more easily than you might think. They have short tempers and their anger can escalate very quickly. Their planet ruler, Mars, is the planet of passion and anger and this is reflected in the sign Aries. But if you hit one of their sensitive topics or hurt one of their friends they can get very defensive. Despite these qualities, Aries are also very loyal and will stick by someone until the very end. They like to fix people's emotions and issues when they arise. However, this can also come accross as clingy and needy to some people. They value trust very deeply and if someone breaks it they are not the most forgiving. In social settings they can be very loud and aggresive but also very fun to be around. They are impulsive and seek out exciting experiences. When you first meet an Aries they can come accross as obnoxious but their true nature is much kinder. This sign can also be excellent leaders if they seperate their emotions from their position. Being the first sign of the Zodiac they like to be first and up front. Be wary of getting into a relationship of any kind with this sign if you don't like clinginess, or if you have a hard time keeping others trust. Overall, Aries are a fun loving and exciting sign but they also can be very emotional and difficult to be close to at times.</p>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>Aries tend to be the most compatible with Leo and Aquarius in Friendship and Libra in Love. They are least compatible with Taurus, Cancer, and Capricorn. Leo and Aquarius can give Aries someone to help in friendship but they are also signs which the Aries can be fun and impulsive with. This creates a dynamic and helpful friendship for both parties. Taurus are very stubborn and can try and combat with Aries on every front which will lead to both signs being unsatisfied and drained from the relationship. Cancers tend to be too sensitive and emotional and Aries fighting nature doesn't suit them well. Aries will be frustrated that they can't fight with the other person and often lose themselves to try to please the other. Capricorns hard-working and straightforward way of approaching life doesn't fit with Aries exciting and impulsive nature which makes it hard for these signs to relate to each other.</p>
